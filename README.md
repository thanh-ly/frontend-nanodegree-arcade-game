#Frogger game clone, Udacity OOJS assignment

##About the game:
You are the player, trying to cross the field without colliding into the enemies (bugs). Use the arrow keys to move left, right, up, down. If you collide with an enemy, your location is reset. If you reach the water without colliding with an enemy, your location is reset and your score increases by 1. 

##Installation instructions:
Download the entirety of the repository and open INDEX.html with your browser. The game automatically starts once the page is fully loaded. 

##Known Bugs: 
No known bugs at this time.
[fixed 2016-08-14] The score marker does not refresh automatically, instead the new score is overwritten onto the old score, eventually creating a solid black character rectangle.
